## This project was built using:

- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Express
- Socket.io
- Material UI

## Assignment requirements implemented:

- User authentication, password hashing, registering, logging in and logging out.
- Middleware is used to handle requests and responses, such as checking for validations and authentication.
- Protected routes - so only logged-in users can access certain actions.
- REST API to handle CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the database.
- Socket.io for real-time communication, such as leaderboard.
